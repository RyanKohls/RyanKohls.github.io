    <h2>Internships and Work Experience</h2>
        <h3>Ernie Ball</h3>
            <p>Ernie Ball manufactures high quality electric guitars and basses, and I had a wonderful experience working there for 1 year as a manufacturing engineering intern.  As a valued member of the engineering team, I contributed to many projects from supporting robot manufacturing cells to data analytics to product development.</p>
            <p>All my projects required working with many departments throughout the company and sometimes foreign suppliers.  Some highlights from my major projects are shown below.</p>
        <h4>Robotic Manufacturing Cell</h4>
            <p>I helped transition the manufacturing of guitar necks and bodies from manual process to a new, automated robotics cell. The robotics cell incorporates:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>6-axis robototic arm</li>
                    <li>RFID System</li>
                    <li>Computer Vision System</li>
                    <li>CNC Mill</li>
                    <li>Human Machine Interface (HMI)</li>
                </ul>
            <p>I implemented hundreds of programs and 25 product families, and the neck cell now manufactures approxmately half of all necks produced by Ernie Ball with superior quality and traceability compared to previous the previous manufacturing processes.</p>
        <h4>Data Analytics</h4>
            <h5>Scrap and Rework Analysis</h5>
                <p>Using Python and Minitab, I analyzed 1 year of data from scrap and rework reports to determine the main factors causing defects.  This is difficult due to the high mix, low volume production of Ernie Ball, as well as the high degree of interaction between factors (many combinations of models, wood types, etc.)</p>
                <p>I developed a generalized linear model (GLM) to account for all possible combinations of products and determined which combinations contribute to the majority of scrap and rework.  This allowed the senior manufacturing engineers to target specific areas for further process improvement projects, as well as providing easy-to-read, visual representations of the results to top management.</p>
            <h5>Automating the Milling Department Scheduling System</h5>
                <p>Historically, the milling department of Ernie Ball scheduled its production of roughly 10,000 instruments per year by hand on a weekly basis. Common issues with this system include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Difficulty accounting for machine downtime</li>
                        <li>Impossible to make long term projections</li>
                        <li>Imbalanced production schedules</li>
                        <li>Slow schedule adjustments</li>
                        <li>Large amount of product knowledge required to make schedule</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>I formulated this as a combinatorial optimization problem and developed a decision support system (DSS) for the milling department.  This automates the scheduling process and provides a friendly user-interface.  The program can schedule 450 different instruments on 7 machines with 16 people in around 10 seconds.</p>
                <p>The program is implemented in Google Drive to allow easy collaboration between the production planning, manufacturing engineering, and milling departments.</p>
        <h4>Product Development</h4>
            <p>I assisted with the design of two major instruments, as well as preparing the factory for mass production of these models for 2018.</p>
            <p>The Stingray bass is one of the most iconic basses in history. I assited in the total redesign of this instrument </p>
            <p>St. Vincent is the first female musician to have her own signature instrument: the St. Vincent Guitar.  I redesigned her signature instrument with a dual humbucking system as well as a new body shape, pickguard, bobbins, and pickup covers. I oversaw several stages of prototyping and design changes to reach the final design, and created programs to mass-manufacture this instrument. This instrument is now in full production for 2018.</p>
