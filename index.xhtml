                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    More than anything, I'm passionate about learning. I enjoy taking deep dives into different areas such as philosophy, optimization, music, and manufacturing, and discovering the unique connections that exist between these fields.  I've had the privilege of interning at Apple, where I enjoyed the fast-paced and perfectionist culture of the electronics manufacturing  department.  I also loved working to provide affordable internet to rural communities in the creative culture at Viasat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently pursuing a master's in <abbr title="Industrial Engineering">IE</abbr> from <abbr title="California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo">Cal Poly SLO</abbr>, and am focusing on using mixed integer programming to optimize the allocation of materials in a global supply chain network. My professional interests include optimization, simulation, printed electronics manufacturing, new product introduction, and statistics. I have had 4 internships and 2 research assistant positions across the consumer electronics, aerospace, telecommunications, and music industries. A timeline of my 44 months of part time and full time work experience is shown below.
