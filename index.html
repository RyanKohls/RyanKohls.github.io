<!--    Introduction/Bio-->
    <p>
        I am a third year Industrial Engineering major at California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly SLO). I have done club-related and personal projects such as building myself a 3D printer and process improvement for a local chocolate factory. I have always excelled in school with a GPA of 3.6, and have worked as a TA/LA for two professors teaching process improvement fundamentals and metal casting. I taught myself programming and currently use Python, mainly for data analysis and operations research. I am proficient with the TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries. In addition, I have around 1,000 hours of 3D modelling and CAM experience spread across Creo, Fusion360, Rhino, and SolidWorks.

        I'm still adding to this website each day, so if you don't see all of the projects now, try coming back tomorrow!
