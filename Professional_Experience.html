            <p>
                I'm very excited to be working as a new product introduction (NPI) engineer at Viasat this summer! I will be working in the Tempe, Arizona office.

            <p>
                As part of the Boeing Engineering Accelerated Mentorship program (BEAM), I worked on engineering challenges and presented a project plan to senior Boeing engineers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I led a project group of 4 people that developed a plan to implement RFID tracking of airline bags including a technical feasibility assessment and cost-benefit analysis.

<!--Ernie Ball-->

            <img src="Media_Resources/Big%20Bird.png" alt="Robot Cell" style="float: right; width: 500px">
            <p>Ernie Ball manufactures high quality electric guitars and basses, and I had a wonderful experience working there for 1 year as a manufacturing engineering intern.  As a valued member of the engineering team, I contributed to many projects from supporting robot manufacturing cells to data analytics to product development.</p>
            <p>All my projects required working with many departments throughout the company and sometimes foreign suppliers.  Some highlights from my major projects are shown below.</p>
        <h4>Robotic Manufacturing Cell</h4>
            <p>I helped transition the manufacturing of guitar necks and bodies from manual process to a new, automated robotics cell. The robotics cell incorporates:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>6-axis robototic arm</li>
            <img id="Guitar" src="Media_Resources/Jason%20Richardson%20Majesty.png" alt="Jason Richardson's Guitar">
                    <li>RFID System</li>
                    <li>Computer Vision System</li>
                    <li>CNC Mill</li>
                    <li>Human Machine Interface (HMI)</li>
                </ul>
            <p>I implemented hundreds of programs and 25 product families, and the neck cell now manufactures approxmately half of all necks produced by Ernie Ball with superior quality and traceability compared to previous the previous manufacturing processes.</p>
        <h4>Data Analytics</h4>
            <h5>Scrap and Rework Analysis</h5>
                <p>Using Python and Minitab, I analyzed 1 year of data from scrap and rework reports to determine the main factors causing defects.  This is difficult due to the high mix, low volume production of Ernie Ball, as well as the high degree of interaction between factors (many combinations of models, wood types, etc.)</p>
                <p>I developed a generalized linear model (GLM) to account for all possible combinations of products and determined which combinations contribute to the majority of scrap and rework.  This allowed the senior manufacturing engineers to target specific areas for further process improvement projects, as well as providing easy-to-read, visual representations of the results to top management.</p>
            <h5>Automating the Milling Department Scheduling System</h5>
                <p>Historically, the milling department of Ernie Ball scheduled its production of roughly 10,000 instruments per year by hand on a weekly basis. Common issues with this system include:</p>
            <img src="Media_Resources/Interaction%20Plot.PNG" alt="Interaction Plot of Scrap" style="width: 500px; float:right">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Difficulty accounting for machine downtime</li>
                        <li>Impossible to make long term projections</li>
                        <li>Imbalanced production schedules</li>
                        <li>Slow schedule adjustments</li>
                        <li>Large amount of product knowledge required to make schedule</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>I formulated this as a combinatorial optimization problem and developed a decision support system (DSS) for the milling department.  This automates the scheduling process and provides a friendly user-interface.  The program can schedule 450 different instruments on 7 machines with 16 people in around 10 seconds.</p>
                <p>The program is implemented in Google Drive to allow easy collaboration between the production planning, manufacturing engineering, and milling departments.</p>

        <h4>Product Development</h4>
            <p>I assisted with the design of two major instruments, as well as preparing the factory for mass production of these models for 2018.</p>
            <img src="Media_Resources/Artisan%20Majesty.jpg" alt="Artisan Majesty Guitar" style="width: 300px; float:right">
            <p>The Stingray bass is one of the most iconic basses in history. I assited in the total redesign of this instrument </p>
            <p>St. Vincent is the first female musician to have her own signature instrument: the St. Vincent Guitar.  I redesigned her signature instrument with a dual humbucking system as well as a new body shape, pickguard, bobbins, and pickup covers. I oversaw several stages of prototyping and design changes to reach the final design, and created programs to mass-manufacture this instrument. This instrument is now in full production for 2018.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>
                As part of a graduate-level class in operations research (IME 541), I developed a simulation that uses competing neural networks to determine the profitability of first degree price discrimination (setting a different price for every consumer) when multiple companies are competing with each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy exploring ideas from multiple fields and tying them together in new ways. This research paper incorporates topics from game theory (decision making involivng multiple rational agents), behavioral economics (behavior of consumers in response to price discrimination), and operations research (maximizing profits using first degree price discrimination is a nonlinear optimization problem).
            </p>
            <p>
                The program was written in Python using TensorFlow, and uses a feedforward neural network classifier.</p>

        <h3>RFID</h3>
            <img src="Media_Resources/RFID%20Logo.jpg" alt="RFID Logo" style="width:250px; float: left; padding-right: 25px">
            <p>As part of Cal Poly's Summer Undergraduate Research Program, I reseached several applications of RFID and operations research.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Use of Drones to Track Livestock</li>
                <li>A Reusable Container System for Smart Cities</li>
                <li>Antenna Coverage of a Manufacturing Environment</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I attended the RFID Journal Live conference at Orlando in 2018 where I was a track chair for the retail and apparel track. </p>
            <p>More information about each of these projects is coming soon.</p>

        <h3>Flexible Electronics</h3>
            <img src="Media_Resources/Flexible%20Electronics%20PCB.jpg" alt="A Flexible Circuit Board" style="width: 250px; float: left; padding-right: 25px">
            <p>I worked as a research assistant where I studied applications of printed and flexible electronics and methods for manufacturing them. I focused on printed sensors, antenna, and passive components (reistors, capacitors, and inductors) using printing methods such as screen printing, gravure, lithography, and inkjet.</p>
            <p>As part of this reseach, I attended the IDTechEx conference in Santa Clara.</p>
